# Hi, I'm Julius 👋

**AI Safety Researcher & Full-Stack Engineer** building responsible AI systems that work in the real world.

## What I Do

- 🛡️ **AI Safety & Governance** — Contributing to global AI safety research coordination through [SPAR](https://sparai.org) and building ethical AI frameworks
- 🏗️ **Product & Engineering** — 8+ years shipping production systems in healthcare, governance, legal tech, and recruitment
- 🎓 **Learning** — Currently pursuing MSc Data Science at University of Ghana, focusing on AI alignment and responsible AI systems
- 🌍 **Impact** — Built systems that reduced legal licensing from 2 months to 5 minutes, and governance tools used by multinational organizations globally

## Current Work

- Building **AI Safety Connect** — a platform mapping global AI safety researchers and organizations
- Developing AI-powered health insights at **CuraAlert** with rigorous safety considerations
- Leading AI governance initiatives at **TheBoardroom Africa**
- Maintaining [CIRIS](https://ciris.ai) — an AI ethical framework (Compliance, Inclusion, Responsibility, Integrity, Safety)

## Tech Stack

**Languages:** Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP  
**Frontend:** React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS  
**Backend:** Node.js, Laravel  
**AI/ML:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, Deep Learning, Neural Networks  
**Cloud & Tools:** AWS, GCP, Azure, Vercel, Git, MySQL  

## Philosophy

I believe AI systems should be:
- **Safe by design** — alignment and governance from day one
- **Transparently deployed** — users should understand how systems affect them
- **Contextually appropriate** — especially critical in emerging markets where governance frameworks are still developing
- **Actually useful** — real-world impact over perfect prototypes

## Notable Projects

- 🏛️ GovernanceBaseline — Data-driven board performance evaluation platform
- ⚖️ Legal Licensing System — Reduced processing time from 60 days to 5 minutes
- 🏥 Health Insurance Management — Streamlined policy administration and claims processing
- 📚 Examination Management System — Automated student progression, resits, and academic decisions
- 🔧 DevLess — Backend-as-a-service platform with 140,000+ downloads
